Slick Slider by Ken Wheeler is used for the question slider - https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/

Recommended to use plugin Visual Term Description Editor by Shea Bunge ( https://github.com/sheabunge/visual-term-description-editor ) because the end of each section pulls it's content from term descriptions.
